		<p>If you are itching to get away but are unsure about the current state of travel, Courtney can help ease your concerns and answer any questions you may have about traveling during a pandemic. Most Caribbean and Mexico resorts are offering the free COVID-19 testing that is now required to re-enter the United States. Many islands also require a COVID-19 test prior to travel, so it is in your best interest to use a professional to guide you through the requirements. </br></br> Resorts are taking great care to sanitize everywhere every couple hours. My clients that have been traveling since last summer said they felt safer at their resort than being out and about in the U.S. </br></br> Keep in mind, there are also</br>great deals going on right now!
